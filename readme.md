> ClassMate is an interactive platform to extend student and teacher communication. In the application, you can create classes as a teacher, and connect your google calendar with specific classes to keep students informed as to when you have anything coming up to do with class. A teacher can also create assignments that students will receive notifications for regarding due dates. A student will be able to login and join the teacher's class via QR code, as well as upload their particiular assignments via photo-upload, and be able to raise their hand via their raising their phone slightly from their desk, where their teacher will be notified and be able to help them quickly.
