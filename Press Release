Teachers and students both agree, ClassMate is the best App for the classroom since the invention of the textbook.  ClassMate is an easy to use classroom management system for teachers to be able to live-track student progress on assignments and projects, send reminders to students for upcoming due dates, and provide interactive quizzes and tests for all students with a single click.  ClassMate also empowers students to instantly see what assignments they have or haven't submitted, raise their digital hand to ask a question, instantly check-in for attendance, and view their daily schedule for the day.  Never before has technology in the classroom been so easy or fun. 

For Teachers:
Teachers are able to sign-in with their Gmail account and are greeted with a user friendly and informative dashboard.  The beautiful da dashboard places all classroom management tools at the teacher's fingertips.  Teachers will see their class schedule for the day that integrates with Google Calendar, so no more guessing on assembly schedules. Clicking on a specific class will bring the teacher to their perfect classroom assistant page.  Students can raise their hand digitally and it becomes instantly added to a queue.  The class photo roster is viewable at a touch and clicking on a student allows teachers to access messaging capabilities, parent contact info, and give students badges.
