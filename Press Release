Teachers and students both agree, ClassMate is the best App for the classroom since the invention of the textbook.  ClassMate is an easy to use classroom management system for teachers to be able to live-track student progress on assignments and projects, send reminders to students for upcoming due dates, and provide interactive quizzes and tests for all students with a single click.  ClassMate also empowers students to instantly see what assignments they have or haven't submitted, raise their digital hand to ask a question, instantly check-in for attendance, and view their daily schedule for the day.  Never before has technology in the classroom been so easy or fun.
